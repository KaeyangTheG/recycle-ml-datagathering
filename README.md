# recycle-ml-datagathering

## To Run: 

I have been using this bundler to bundle/serve the application: 
https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel

`npm i -g parcel-bundler` 

Within the root of the repo: 
`parcel index.html` 

## Todo: 

Common dropbox folder? (Currently it will just upload to an individual folder) 
Upload to google cloud storage instead of dropbox?
